# 🔧 Attachment Flow Fixes

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **File Upload Processing Bug**
- **Problem**: `attachments` array was being recreated for each file, causing async callback issues
- **Fix**: Moved `attachments` array outside the forEach loop and added proper counter tracking
- **Result**: Multiple files now process correctly and all attachments are properly collected

### 2. **Attachment Display in Messages**
- **Problem**: Attachments weren't showing in message bubbles after sending
- **Fix**: Fixed the file processing logic to ensure attachments are properly passed to the message
- **Result**: Attachments now display correctly in user message bubbles

### 3. **Submit Button Logic**
- **Problem**: Submit button was disabled when attachments were present but no text
- **Fix**: Updated logic to allow sending with attachments only: `(!inputValue.trim() && pendingAttachments.length === 0)`
- **Result**: Can now send messages with just attachments

## 🚀 **Technical Changes Made**

### **FileUpload.tsx**
```typescript
// BEFORE: attachments array created inside forEach (broken)
Array.from(files).forEach((file) => {
  const attachments: Attachment[] = []; // ❌ New array each time
  // ... async processing
});

// AFTER: attachments array created once, proper counter tracking
const attachments: Attachment[] = [];
let processedCount = 0;
const totalFiles = /* calculate supported files */;

Array.from(files).forEach((file) => {
  // ... file processing
  reader.onload = (e) => {
    attachments.push(attachment);
    processedCount++;
    if (processedCount === totalFiles) {
      onFilesSelected(attachments); // ✅ All files processed
    }
  };
});
```

### **ChatInterface.tsx**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Attachments cleared immediately (could cause race conditions)
await sendMessage(message, pendingAttachments);
setPendingAttachments([]); // ❌ Cleared before message sent

// AFTER: Attachments copied and cleared safely
const attachmentsToSend = [...pendingAttachments];
setPendingAttachments([]); // ✅ Clear UI immediately
await sendMessage(message, attachmentsToSend);
// ✅ Restore attachments if sending fails
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Upload Flow:**
1. **Click Upload Button** → File picker opens
2. **Select Files** → Files are processed asynchronously
3. **Files Processed** → Attachments appear above input field
4. **Type Message (Optional)** → Can send with or without text
5. **Click Send** → Message and attachments sent together
6. **Message Sent** → Attachments display in message bubble

### **Attachment Display:**
- **Pending Attachments**: Show above input field with preview
- **Message Attachments**: Display in message bubbles using `AttachmentDisplay`
- **File Types**: Images show preview, documents show file icon
- **Multiple Files**: All files processed and displayed together
