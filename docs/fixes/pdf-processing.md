# 📄 PDF & Document Processing Fixes

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Aggressive Upload Prompts**
- **Problem**: Input placeholder was too pushy about uploads
- **Fix**: Changed placeholder from "Type your message or ask about the images..." to "Type your message..."
- **Result**: Clean, non-aggressive interface

### 2. **PDF Processing Getting Stuck**
- **Problem**: PDFs were being sent as base64 data URLs but Gemini couldn't read them directly
- **Fix**: Added PDF text extraction using `pdf-parse` library
- **Result**: PDFs are now processed and their text content is extracted and sent to Gemini

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **PDF Processing Flow:**
1. User uploads PDF file
2. File is converted to base64 and sent to server
3. Server extracts text content using `pdf-parse`
4. Text content is appended to the user's message
5. Gemini receives the message with PDF content
6. AI can analyze, summarize, or answer questions about the PDF

### **Example Usage:**
```
User uploads: "financial_report.pdf"
User message: "Summarize this document"

AI receives:
"Summarize this document

**PDF Document: financial_report.pdf**
[Full text content of the PDF...]"

AI responds with summary of the PDF content
```
