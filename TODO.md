## üî¥ CRITICAL - Required Before Production

### 1. Revoke Exposed API Keys

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes
**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING

API keys were accidentally committed to git history and pushed to GitHub. Even though they've been removed from git history, they may have been scraped by bots.

**Steps:**

1. **Revoke Gemini API Key**
   - Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - Find and delete key: `AIzaSyDScNnwqyPkWgXkKj5iOIzApg4sO136C4w`
   - Generate a new key
   - Save it securely

2. **Revoke Google Search API Key**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Find and delete key: `AIzaSyDpfsyqvczepccVFgxmMapy62pJtBd0cpQ`
   - Generate a new key
   - Save it securely

3. **Update Local Environment**
   ```bash
   # Update .env.local with new keys
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_gemini_key_here
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_new_search_key_here
   ```

3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add/Update these variables:

   ```bash
   # Required
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_gemini_key_here
   NODE_ENV=production

   # CRITICAL NEW VARIABLE (for rate limiting to work properly)
   TRUST_PROXY=true

   # Optional but recommended
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_new_search_key_here
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id_here

   # Optional - Error tracking (only if you want Sentry)
   SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_client_dsn_here

## üü† HIGH - Recommended Before Production

### 3. Test Critical Functionality

**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes
**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING

After deploying with new environment variables, test these critical features:

- [ ] **Share Feature**: Create a share link and verify it works

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Send 30+ requests in 1 minute, verify 429 response
- [ ] **Chat Functionality**: Send messages and verify AI responses work
- [ ] **File Uploads**: Upload an image and verify it's processed

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/healthz

# Test rate limiting (should get 429 after 30 requests)
for i in {1..35}; do curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/chat -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"test"}'; done

# Test CSRF endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/csrf
```
